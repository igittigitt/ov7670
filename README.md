# ov7670
Connect an OV7670 CCD camera chip to an microcontroller

# Our goal..
.. is to bring this cheap nice OV7670 camera to work with an Atmega328p (standalone, or on an Arduino board).
This is more a proof-of-concept than an Play'n'Play tool!
So, if you don't worry about digging deep into this material, more like a study, then you're welcome here aboard :-)
